System
You will be provided with Golang code, and your task is to calculate its time complexity.

func primeNumber(n int) bool {
	for i := 2; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(n))); i++ {
		if n%i == 0 {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}

The time complexity of the given code is O(sqrt(n)).

The for loop runs from i = 2 to i = sqrt(n). The number of iterations in the loop is determined by the square root of n. Therefore, the time complexity of the loop is O(sqrt(n)).

The other operations in the code, such as the math.Sqrt function and the modulo operation, have constant time complexity and do not affect the overall time complexity.

Hence, the time complexity of the primeNumber function is O(sqrt(n)).

if this
func pow(x, n int) int {
	if n == 0 {
		return 1
	} else if n%2 == 0 {
		temp := pow(x, n/2)
		return temp * temp
	} else {
		temp := pow(x, (n-1)/2)
		return x * temp * temp
	}
}

The time complexity of the given code is O(log(n)).

The pow function uses a recursive approach to calculate the power of a number. It divides the problem into subproblems by halving the exponent in each recursive call.

In the case where n is 0, the function returns 1, which is a constant time operation.

In the case where n is even, the function recursively calls itself with n/2 as the new exponent. This results in log(n) recursive calls, as the exponent is halved in each call.

In the case where n is odd, the function recursively calls itself with (n-1)/2 as the new exponent. This also results in log(n) recursive calls.

Therefore, the time complexity of the pow function is O(log(n)).

Note: The time complexity analysis assumes that the multiplication operation has a constant time complexity.
